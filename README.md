# akka-grpc
Akka GRPC (will be open source)

# server

Provides the server code necessary to implement gRPC protocol, and provides a way to turn an interface (manually written, but presumably will be generated by scalapb eventually), a descriptor describing it (will also be generated), and a manually written implementation, into something that Akka HTTP will serve.

There's a test class that creates a gRPC client (using scalapb) to then test the server. In order to run it, you need to make sure that `akka.example.org` resolves to `127.0.0.1`.
